<strong>Welcome to Allways!</strong>

This app is designed to combine public transportation directions with driving directions, for those of us who drive to the train station. Google Maps doesn't do it. Waze can't do it. But Allways can do it. Get you an app that can do both. -Troy and Aaron

<strong>Technologies Used</strong>
<ul>
<li>Axios to facilitate our database calls</li>
<li>Google Maps API for current location, traffic conditions, and turn-by-turn directions</li>
<li>BART API data for station location information</li>
<li>Bootstrap for some minor styles</li>
</ul>


<strong>Existing Features</strong>

Currently, Allways finds the user's current location, displays the closest BART station, and provides turn-by-turn driving directions to the station. This is all done automatically, as soon as the user enables Allways to see current location.

Once the user enters a destination, Allways will provide a destination BART station, as well as directions from the destination BART station to the user's final destination.

The app also displays live traffic conditions, starting point and destination point, on an interactive Google Maps interface.

<strong>Planned Future Features</strong>

We plan to add the following features:
<ul>
<li>Travel time estimates</li>
<li>BART routes and live timetables</li>
<li>An up-to-the-minute feed of BART incidents</li>
<li>User authentication</li>
<li>Ability for users to save and view their trip history</li>
<li>Expand to other public transit systems (in the distant future)</li>
</ul>
